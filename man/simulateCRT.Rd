\description{
\code{simulateCRT} generates simulated data for a cluster randomized trial (CRT) with geographic contamination between arms.
}
\details{
Synthetic data are generated by sampling around the values of
variable \code{propensity}, which is a numerical vector
(taking positive values) of length equal to the number of locations.
There are three ways in which \code{propensity} can arise:
\enumerate{
\item \code{propensity} can be provided as part of the input \code{trial} object.
\item Baseline numerators and denominators (values of \code{baselineNumerator}
and \code{baselineDenominator} may be provided.
\code{propensity} is then generated as the numerator:denominator ratio
for each location in the input object
\item Otherwise \code{propensity} is generated using a 2D Normal
kernel density. The \href{https://rdrr.io/cran/OOR/man/StoSOO.html}{\code{OOR::StoSOO}}
is used to achieve an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) that approximates
the value of \code{'ICC_inp'} by searching for an appropriate value of the kernel bandwidth.
}
\code{num[i]}, the synthetic outcome for location \code{i}
is simulated with expectation: \cr
\deqn{\code{E(num[i]) = outcome0[i] * propensity[i] * denom[i] * (1 - effect*I[i])/mean(outcome0[] * propensity[])}} \cr
The sampling distribution of \code{num[i]} depends on the value of \code{scale} as follows: \cr
\tabular{llll}{
\code{scale}=’continuous’ \tab Values of \code{num} are sampled from a
Normal distributions with means \code{E(num[i])}
and variance determined by \code{vr} and the fitting to \code{ICC_inp}.\cr
\code{scale}=’count’ \tab Simulated events are allocated to locations via multivariate hypergeometric distributions
parameterised with \code{E(num[i])}.\cr
\code{scale}=’proportion’\tab Simulated events are allocated to locations via multinomial distributions
parameterised with \code{E(num[i])}.\cr
}
\code{denominator} may specify a vector of numeric (non-zero) values
in the input \code{"CRTsp"} or \code{data.frame} which is returned
as variable \code{denom}. It acts as a scale-factor for continuous outcomes, rate-multiplier
for counts, or denominator for proportions. For discrete data all values of \code{denom}
must be > 0.5 and are rounded to the nearest integer in calculations of \code{num}.\cr\cr
By default, \code{denom} is generated as a vector of ones, leading to simulation of
dichotomous outcomes if \code{scale}=’proportion’.\cr

If baseline numerators and denominators are provided then the output vectors
\code{base_denom} and  \code{base_num} are set to the input values. If baseline numerators and denominators
are not provided then the synthetic baseline data are generated by sampling around \code{propensity} in the same
way as the outcome data, but with the effect size set to zero.

If \code{matchedPair} is \code{TRUE} then pair-matching on the baseline data will be used in randomization providing
there are an even number of clusters. If there are an odd number of clusters then matched pairs are not generated and
an unmatched randomization is output.

Either \code{sd} or \code{theta_inp} must be provided. If both are provided then
the value of \code{sd} is overwritten
by the standard deviation implicit in the value of \code{theta_inp}.
Contamination is simulated as arising from a diffusion-like process.
