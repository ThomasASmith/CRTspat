\value{
A trial design object comprising a list with the following attributes:
\itemize{
\item \code{arm}: vector of assignments to trial arms
\item \code{alpha}: confidence level
\item \code{desiredPower}: desired power
\item \code{effect}: Required effect size
\item \code{ICC}: Intra-Cluster Correlation obtained from other studies
\item \code{nominalDE}: calculated Design Effect
\item \code{pC}: baseline prevalence
\item \code{n_ind}: required individuals per arm in an individually randomized trial
\item \code{postulatedContaminationRange}: contamination range in km, obtained from other studies
\item \code{h}: proposal for the number of households in each cluster
\item \code{algo}: algorithm used for cluster boundaries
\item \code{assignments}: data frame containing locations, clusters and arm assignments
\item \code{min_c}: minimum number of clusters required
}
}
\description{
\code{Design_CRT} estimates the required number of clusters and the extent of contamination between arms for a CRT with the input set of locations.
Outputs are:
(i) Estimates of the required numbers of clusters.
(ii) A proposal for the cluster and arm assignments to the input coordinates. (A warning is output if the number of locations is too small to allow randomisation of sufficient clusters).
(iii) the proportion of households in the input geography falling within the core of the clusters (i.e. outside the contamination range of locations in the opposite arm)
