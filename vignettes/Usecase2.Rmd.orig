Effects of settlement patterns, choices of cluster size and buffer widths, and the extent of spillover between arms on the outcomes of CRTs do not lend themselves to mathematical analysis. Simulations of trials are used to explore the effects of these variables on trial power and on the robustness of statistical methodologies.

Trials can be simulated using the `simulateCRT` function, which augments a `trial` data frame (created externally) or object of class `CRTsp` (created by package functions) with simulated outcome data.  The input object must be given location information and both cluster and arm assignments (see [Use Case 1](Usecase1.html)) (or the package can generate these if the objective is purely simulation.

Information about the underlying spatial pattern of disease is used in the form of the intra-cluster correlation of the outcome, which is input to the simulation as variable `ICC_inp`, and of the `propensity`. The former takes a single value for the chosen design. The latter takes a positive real value for each location. In the case of malaria, `propensity` can be thought of as measuring exposure to infectious mosquitoes.

`ICC_inp` and `propensity` may either be estimated from other datasets or supplied by the user. The behaviour of the function depends on which variables are supplied, and the value of `generateBaseline`,  as follows:

| Data supplied by the user | Function behaviour |
|:-------------------|:--------------------------|
|`propensity` supplied by user|Baseline data are created by sampling around `propensity`|
|Baseline data are supplied by user and `propensity` is not supplied |`propensity` is created from the baseline data|
|Neither baseline data nor `propensity` are supplied |`propensity` is generated using normal kernels, with the bandwidth adjusted to achieve the input value of the `ICC_inp` (after the further smoothing stage to simulate spillover (see below))|

The effect of intervention is simulated as a fixed percentage reduction in the `propensity`. Contamination or spillover between trial arms is then modelled as a additional smoothing process applied to the intervention-adjusted `propensity` via a further bivariate normal kernel. In the case of mosquito borne disease this is proposed as an approximation to the effect of mosquito movement. The degree of spillover is specified either as a spillover interval with the `theta_inp` parameter, or as `sd`, the bandwidth of the corresponding normal kernel. If both are provided then it is the value of `theta_inp` that is used.

#### Example with baseline data provided as proportions
```{r example2a.r, fig.keep = 'none', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, include=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
library(CRTspat)
set.seed(1234)
example_locations <- readdata('example_site.csv')
example_locations$base_denom <- 1
library(dplyr)
example_randomized <- CRTsp(example_locations) %>%
  aggregateCRT(auxiliaries = c("RDT_test_result", "base_denom")) %>%
  specify_clusters(h = 50, algorithm = 'NN') %>%
  randomizeCRT(matchedPair = FALSE)
summary(example_randomized)
plotCRT(example_randomized, map = TRUE, legend.position = c(0.8, 0.8))
  example2a <- simulateCRT(example_randomized,
           effect = 0.8,
           outcome0 = 0.5,
           generateBaseline = FALSE,
           baselineNumerator = "RDT_test_result",
           baselineDenominator = "base_denom",
           ICC_inp = 0.05, theta_inp = 0.8)

#### Example with infectiousness proxy surface generated externally
```{r example2b.r, fig.keep = 'none', echo = TRUE}
set.seed(1234)
# Simulate a site with 2000 locations
new_site <- CRTsp(geoscale = 2, locations=2000, kappa=3, mu=40)
# propensity surface generated as an arbitrary linear function of x the co-ordinate
new_site$trial$propensity <- 0.5*new_site$trial$x - min(new_site$trial$x)+1
library(dplyr)
example2b<- CRTsp(new_site) %>%
   specify_clusters(h = 40, algorithm = 'NN') %>%
   randomizeCRT(matchedPair = FALSE) %>%
   simulateCRT(effect = 0.8,
