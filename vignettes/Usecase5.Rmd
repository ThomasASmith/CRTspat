The [`CRTanalysis()`](../reference/CRTanalysis.html) function is a wrapper for different statistical analysis packages that can be used to analyse either simulated or real trial datasets. It is designed for use in simulation studies of different analytical methods for spatial CRTs by automating the data processing and selecting some appropriate analysis options. It does not replace conventional use of these packages. Real field trials very often entail complications that are not catered for any of the analysis options in `CRTanalysis()` and it does not aspire to carry out the full analytical workflow for a trial. It can be used as part of a wider workflow. In particular the usual object output by the statistical analysis package constitutes the `model_object` element within the `CRTanalysis` object generated by `CRTanalysis()`. This can be accessed by the usual methods (e.g `predict()`, `summary()`, `plot()`) which may be needed for diagnosing errors, assessing goodness of fit, and for identifying needs for additional analyses.

## Statistical Methods

The options that can be specified using the `method` parameter in the function call are:

+ `method = "T"` summarises the outcome at the level of the cluster, and uses 2-sample t-tests to carry out statistical significance tests of the effect, and to compute confidence intervals for the effect size. The [t.test](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/t.test) function in the `stats` package is used.
+	`method = "GEE"` uses Generalised Estimating Equations to estimate the efficacy in a model with iid random effects for the clusters. An estimate of the intracluster correlation (ICC) is also provided. This uses calls to the [geepack](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v015i02) package.
+	`method = "LME4"` fits linear (for continuous data) or generalized linear (for counts and proportions) mixed models with iid random effects for clusters in [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/lme4.pdf).
+ `method = "MCMC"` uses Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation in package [jagsUI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jagsUI/index.html), which calls r-JAGS.
+ `method = "INLA"` uses approximate Bayesian inference via the [R-INLA package](https://www.r-inla.org/). This provides functionality for geostatistical analysis, which can be used for geographical mapping of model outputs (as illustrated in . INLA spatial analysis requires a prediction mesh. This can be generated using [`CRTspat::new_mesh()`](../reference/new_mesh().html). This can be computationally expensive, so it is recommended to compute the mesh just once for each dataset.

All these analysis methods can be used to carry out a simple comparision of outcomes between trial arms. Each offers different additional functionality, and has its own limitations (see Table 5.1). Some of these limitations are specific to the options offered within `CRTanalysis()`, which does not embrace the full range of options of the packages that are 'wrapped'. These are specified using the `method` argument of the function.

Table 5.1. Available statistical methods

| `method` | Package | What the `CRTanalysis()` implementation offers |Limitations (as implemented) |
|----------|---------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `T`| [t.test](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/t.test) | P-values and confidence intervals for efficacy based on comparison of cluster means | No analysis of contamination or degree of clustering |
| `GEE` | [geepack](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v015i02) | Interval estimates for efficacy and Intra-cluster correlations | No analysis of contamination or degree of clustering |
| `LME4`| [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/lme4.pdf) | Analysis of contamination | No geostatistical analysis |
| `INLA` | [INLA](https://www.r-inla.org/) | Analysis of contamination, geostatistical analysis and spatially structured outputs | Computationally intensive |
| `MCMC` | [jagsUI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jagsUI/index.html) | Interval estimates for contamination parameters | Identifiability issues and slow convergence are possible |

For the analysis of proportions, the outcome in the control arm is estimated as: $\hat{p}_{C} = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-\beta_1)}$, in the intervention arm as $\hat{p}_{I} = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-\beta_1-\beta_2)}$, and the efficacy is estimated as $\tilde{E}_{s} = 1- \frac{\tilde{p}_{I}}{\tilde{p}_{C}}$ where $\beta_1$ is the intercept term and $\beta_2$ the incremental effect associated with the intervention.

`summary("<analysis>"")` is used to view the key results of the trial. To display the
output from the statistical procedure that is called, try `<analysis>$model_object` or
`summary("<analysis>$model_object")`.

## Assessing model fit

The `model = "LME4"` option outputs the deviance of the model and the Akaike information criterion (AIC), which can be
used to select the best fitting model. The deviance information criterion (DIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) perform the same role for the Bayesian methods (`"INLA"`, and `"MCMC"`).  The comparison of results with `cfunc = "X"` and `cfunc = "Z"` is used to assess whether the intervention effect is likely to be due to chance. With `method = "T"`, `cfunc = "X"` provides a significance test of the intervention effect directly. The models with contamination (see below) can be compared by that with `cfunc = "X"` to evaluate whether contamination has led to an important bias.


## Contamination (spillover)

`CRTanalysis()` provides options for analysing contamination between arms, or spillover effects either:

*by assuming the effects to be a function of Euclidean distance* to the opposing arm of the trial. The functional forms for this relationship is specified by the value of  `cfunc` (Table 5.2). In addition, models that do not consider contamination can be
fitted using options `Z` and `X`. These are included both to allow conventional analyses, and also to enable
model selection using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and likelihood ratio tests.

Table 5.2. Available contamination functions

| `cfunc` | Description | Formula for $P\left( d \right)$ | Compatible `method`(s)   |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `Z`| No intervention effect | $P\left( d \right) = \ 0\ $ | `GEE` `LME4` `INLA` `MCMC` |
| `X`| Simple intervention effect |  $\begin{matrix}
     P\left( d \right) = \ 0\ for\ d\  < \ 0 \\
     P\left( d \right) = \ 1\ for\ d\  > \ 0 \\
     \end{matrix}\ $ | `T` `GEE` `LME4` `INLA` `MCMC` |
| `L`| inverse logistic (sigmoid)|  $P\left( d \right) = \ \frac{1}{\left( 1\  + \ exp\left( - \beta d \right) \right)}$ | `LME4` `INLA` `MCMC`  |
| `P`| inverse probit (error function) | $P\left( d \right) = \frac{1}{2}\left( 1\  + \ erf\left( \frac{\text{Î²d}}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \right)$ | `LME4` `INLA` `MCMC`  |
| `S`| piecewise linear | $\begin{matrix}
    P\left( d \right) = \ 0\  for\ d\  < \  - \beta/2\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\
    P\left( d \right) = \ \left(\beta/2\  + \ d \right)/\beta\ for\  - \beta/2 < d\  < \ \beta/2\\
    P\left( d \right) = \ 1\  for\ d\  > \ \beta/2\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \\
    \end{matrix}\ $ | `LME4` `INLA` `MCMC` |
| `R`| rescaled linear | $P\left( d \right) =\frac{d\ -\ min(d)}{max(d)\ -\ min(d)}$ | `LME4` `INLA` `MCMC` |

`cfunc` options `P`, `L` and `S` (and also `measure` options `disc`) lead to non-linear models in which the contamination
scale parameter `beta` must be estimated. This is done by selecting `beta` using a one-dimensional optimisation of the goodness of fit of the model in `stats::optimize()`.

The different values for `cfunc` lead to the fitted curves shown in Figure 5.1. The light blue shaded part of the
plot corresponds to the contamination interval in those cases where this is estimated.

  <em>Fig 5.1 Fitted curves for the example dataset with different options for `cfunc`</em>
</p>

The piecewise linear contamination function, `cfunc = "S"`, is only linear on the scale of the linear predictor. When used in a logistic model, as here, the transformation via the inverse of the link function leads to a slightly curved plot (Figure 5.1S). The rescaled linear function, `cfunc = "R"`, is provided as a comparator and for use with `measure` values other than `measure = "nearestDiscord"` see below (it should not be used to estimate the contamination range).

The full set of different `cfunc` options are available for each of model options `"LME4"`, `"INLA"`, and `"MCMC"`.
The performance of all these different models has not yet been thoroughly investigated. The analyses of [Multerer *et al.* (2021b)](https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-021-03924-7) found that that a model equivalent to  `method = "MCMC"`, `cfunc = "L"` gave estimates of efficacy with low bias, even in simulations with considerable contamination.

Contamination can also be analysed *by assuming the effect size to be a function of the number of intervened locations in the surroundings of the location*
[Anaya-Izquierdo & Alexander(2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/biom.13316). Several different functions
are available (Table 5.3). These are specified by the `measure` parameter.

Table 5.3. Available surround functions

| `measure` | Description | Details |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|`nearestDiscord`| Distance to nearest discordant location | The default. This is used for analyses by distance (see above) |
|`hdep`| Tukey's half-depth | Algorithm of [Rousseeuw & Ruts(1996)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2986073)   |
|`sdep`| Simplicial depth| Algorithm of [Rousseeuw & Ruts(1996)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2986073)    |
|`disc`| disc | The number of intervened locations within the specified radius (excluding the location itself) as described by [Anaya-Izquierdo & Alexander(2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/biom.13316) |

The [`compute_distance()`](../reference/compute_distance.html) function is provided to compute these quantities, so that they can be
described, compared, and analysed independently of `CRTanalysis()`. Users can also devise other measures of surround or distance,
add them to a `trial` data frame and specify them using `measure`.



```r
examples <- compute_distance(trial = example$trial, measure = "all", radius = 0.15)
ps1 <- plotCRT(examples, measure = "hdep", legend.position = c(0.8, 0.8))
ps2 <- plotCRT(examples, measure = "sdep")
ps3 <- plotCRT(examples, measure = "disc")
plot_grid(ps1, ps2, ps3, labels = c('hdep', 'sdep', 'disc'), label_size = 10, ncol = 2)
```

<p>
  <img src="example5c.r-1.png"> <br>
  <em>Fig 5.2 Stacked bar plots for different surrounds</em>
</p>

If `measure` is assigned a value of either `hdep`, `sdep`, or `disc`, then `cfunc = "R"` is used and the overall effect size is
computed by comparing the fitted values of the model for a surround value of zero with that of the maximum of the surround in the data. If `measure = "disc"` the radius is estimated in the same way as `beta` (see above Table 5.2).

## Geostatistical models and mapping results

To carry out a geostatistical analysis with `method = "INLA"` a prediction mesh is needed. By default a very low
resolution mesh is created (creating a high resolution mesh is computationally expensive). To create a 100m INLA mesh
for `<MyTrial>`, use:

`mesh <- new_mesh(trial = <MyTrial> , pixel = 0.1)`
