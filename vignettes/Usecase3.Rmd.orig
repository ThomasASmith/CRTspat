The Intracluster Correlation Coefficient (ICC) is one of the inputs to standard power and sample size calculations for CRTs. Trialists often have difficulty identifying an appropriate source for their
ICC calculations, or use a value from a source of questionable relevance.

The [`CRTanalysis`](../reference/CRTanalysis.html) function has an option to use Generalised Estimating Equations, which provide an estimate of the ICC. This can be applied to baseline data, and hence to different cluster configurations. This makes it possible to estimate the ICC which is appropriate for any given cluster definition, in the chosen geography, assuming baseline data are available.

```{r example3a.r, fig.keep = 'none', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# use the same dataset as for Use Case 1.
library(CRTspat)
example_locations <- readdata('example_site.csv')
example_locations$base_denom <- 1
library(dplyr)
example <- CRTsp(example_locations) %>%
    aggregateCRT(auxiliaries = c("RDT_test_result", "base_denom"))
summary(example)

# randomly sample an array of values of c (use a small sample size for testing
# the plots were produced with n=5000)
set.seed(5)
c_vec <- round(runif(50, min = 6, max = 150))

# a user function randomizes and analyses each simulated trial
CRTscenario3 <- function(c, CRT) {
    ex <- specify_clusters(CRT, c = c, algo = "kmeans") %>%
        randomizeCRT()
      GEEanalysis <- CRTanalysis(ex, method = "GEE", baselineOnly = TRUE, excludeBuffer = FALSE,
          baselineNumerator = "RDT_test_result", baselineDenominator = "base_denom")
    locations <- GEEanalysis$description$locations
    ICC <- GEEanalysis$pt_ests$ICC
    value <- c(c = c, ICC = ICC, mean_h = locations/c)
    return(value)
}

# The results are collected in a data frame
results <- t(sapply(c_vec, FUN = CRTscenario3, simplify = "array", CRT = example)) %>%
    data.frame()
```

There is a clear downward trend in the ICC estimates, as cluster size increases (Figure 3.1). The ICC
expected for a trial in this, or similar, geographies can be read off the curve. Note that the ICC is expected to vary
not just with cluster size, but also to vary between different outcomes.

```{r example3b.r, fig.keep = 'none', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, include=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 14))
ggplot(data = results, aes(x = mean_h, y = ICC)) + geom_smooth() +
  xlab("Mean locations per cluster") + ylab("Intracluster correlation") +
  ylim(0.08, 0.15) + xlim(10, 600)
```
