# CRTspillover

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

CRTspillover is an R-package to provide easily accessible R functions
for design and analysis of cluster randomized trials (CRTs), where
geographically structured contamination is anticipated and where
geolocations are available. It includes functions for analysing baseline
data, for defining clusters by algorithm, for power and sample size
calculation, and for analysis of trial outcomes.

The package was developed with CRTs of malaria interventions in mind,
where the contamination is assumed to arise as a result of mosquito
movement, with mosquito dispersal approximated with a simple diffusion
model.

## Installation

There is so far no formally released version of CRTspillover.
